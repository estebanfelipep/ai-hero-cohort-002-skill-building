This piece of project work will be about not only retrieving the email itself but also retrieving emails it's linked to.

We can then pass all of these emails including their threads into the re-ranker.

We can also fiddle with the number of emails that are returned from threads, and how many before the email and after the email are included.

We could even explore here what it would be like allowing an LLM to be able to fetch the entire thread in a tool call.
