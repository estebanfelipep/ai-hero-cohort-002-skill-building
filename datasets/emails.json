As we discussed, this process involves gathering evidence for both your full-time employment and recent freelance consulting income.\n\nRequired Documents:\n- Last 3 months of payslips from TechFlow Solutions\n- P60 for previous tax year\n- 6 months of personal bank statements\n- Invoices/proof of income from freelance consulting work\n- Proof of existing savings/deposit (last 3 bank statements)\n- Identification documents (passport/driving license)\n- Utility bill as proof of current address\n\nA few notes on the freelance income: Since you're in the early stages, we'll want to see consistent invoicing and bank deposits. Typically, we look for at least 3-6 months of documented income.\n\nPlease scan and upload documents to our secure client portal. Let me know if you have any questions.\n\nBest regards,\nDavid Xu\nMortgage Advisor\nFirst Home Mortgages\n+44 (0)161 555 3214",

    "body": "Hi Jennifer,\n\nThanks for the follow-up! Your summary looks spot on. The only thing I'd add is that we're really keen on good energy efficiency - Alex is big on sustainability and I'd love to minimize our carbon footprint. If you spot any properties with recent insulation upgrades or good EPC ratings, that would be amazing.\n\nAlso, we're flexible on exact location within Chorlton - we love the community vibe and green spaces. Happy to look at properties near the community garden or close to public transport links.\n\nLooking forward to seeing what you find!\n\nCheers,\nSarah",

When Tom and I went through this last year, I wish someone had given me some real advice. A few things I learned:\n\n• Don't fall in love with the first place - we did and got CRUSHED when it fell through\n• Always budget 10-15% over what you think you'll spend on unexpected stuff\n• Get a really good survey done - we found some dodgy electrics in our second choice that saved us major headaches\n\nWould love to grab a coffee and chat through your search. Want to hear all the details! Any specific challenges you're facing?\n\nLove,\nSoph xx\n\nSent from my iPhone",

    "body": "Hi Sarah,\n\nI'm excited to share more details about the property at 42 Albert Road in Chorlton that you and Alex viewed last weekend. As we discussed, this Victorian terrace ticks so many of your wishlist boxes:\n\n• 3 bedrooms (potential for home office/studio)\n• Original period features (gorgeous bay windows, high ceilings)\n• Recently renovated kitchen\n• Small but lovely rear garden\n• Walking distance to local cafes and green spaces\n\nThe current owners have maintained the property beautifully. The energy efficiency rating is B, which is excellent for a Victorian home. I know you mentioned being interested in sustainable living, so thought you'd appreciate that detail.\n\nWould you like to schedule a follow-up viewing or discuss making an offer? The property has only been on the market for 2 weeks, and I've had decent interest.\n\nBest,\nJennifer\n\n---\nJennifer Lawson\nSenior Sales Negotiator\nRightmove Property Services\nm: 07700 900123",

Any known issues with damp/structural concerns? (We're a bit cautious after our last viewing)\n2. What's the current seller's timeline?\n3. Any flexibility on price? We were thinking of offering £5k under asking.\n\nWould love to chat more this week.

The property is listed at £385,000, and based on my market analysis, I believe we have some room for negotiation.\n\nMy initial recommendation would be to come in at £370,000 - about £5k under asking. The property has been on the market for 6 weeks, which suggests the sellers might be open to a slightly lower offer. The home is in good condition, but there are a few minor updates that could justify our position.\n\nWhat are your thoughts?
